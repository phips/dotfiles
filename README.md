# Config files for home dirs

Out with the old, in with the new.

My dotfiles.

## tmux

Install [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) first:

`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`

Open tmux, `ctrl-b I`

## neovim

Open it. Plugins should load. Might want to run :Mason and install LSPs.
