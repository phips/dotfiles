# Config files for home dirs

Use:
    $ ./linkit.sh PROFILE

...where PROFILE is a directory in override/ and usually corresponds to a
workplace.

Default action, without specifying an override PROFILE, is for home.

In the bin/ dir is a small script to check a list of dependent apps. Stuff I
like to have installed, basically.

Look at the README in
[dotvim](https://github.com/phips/dotfiles/master/default/dotvim/bundle) for
some extra Vim goodies you could install should you choose.
