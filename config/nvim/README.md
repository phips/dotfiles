# Neovim Setup

I tried all the 'quick start' things, and all of them obscure learning how to
set Neovim up. Coming from an organic Vim setup, developed over 25 years, I
wanted to learn what was different when using Lua. So I followed [this
video](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=MOMEEESQobx-zMa8) then steadily got
things how I want them.

Things I now couldn't live without … telescope, blink.cmp + snippets, which-key.
